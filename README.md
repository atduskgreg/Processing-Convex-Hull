## An Implementation of the Convex Hull Algorithm for Processing

This sketch implements the Convex Hull Algorithm from [Computational Geometry by deBerg et al](http://www.amazon.com/Computational-Geometry-Algorithms-Applications-Edition/dp/3540656200/ideasfordozens-20). The algorithm takes a set of points and figures out which points beyond to the convex polygon that contains the full set. It does so in a slightly clever manner that is *O(nlogn)*. The code is well-commented.
